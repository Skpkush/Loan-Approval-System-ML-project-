**Project Description for Loan Approval System**



Project Title: Loan Approval System Using Machine Learning

Overview: This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the approval status of loan applications based on various features such as applicant income, credit score, and loan amount. By leveraging classification techniques, the model aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

Objective: The goal is to create an accurate predictive model that evaluates loan applications to determine whether they should be approved or rejected, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing risk.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Data Visualization: Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between variables (e.g., education level and loan status).
Model Training: Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict loan approval status.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy metrics on both training and test datasets.
Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 79.86% on the training data and 83.33% on the test data, indicating a reliable performance in predicting loan approvals.
